<h1>Introduction to HTML:</h1>
<hr>
<p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the markup language used to create web pages. It is a tag-based language that is used to give structure and format to the content of a web page. Each tag has a specific meaning and is used to define different elements of a web page, such as titles, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

<h3>Basic HTML concepts:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tags: As mentioned earlier, HTML is made up of tags. Each tag has a specific meaning and is used to format the content of a page. Tags are always written between angle brackets < >.</li>

<li>Attributes: Many tags have attributes that are used to provide additional information about the element. For example, the &lt;img&gt; tag has a "src" attribute that is used to specify the path of the image. Attributes are always written within the tag, and have the format "name="value"".</li>

<li>Content: The content of a web page is written between the opening and closing tags of each element. For example, the content of a paragraph is written between the &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; tags.</li>

<li>Basic structure of an HTML document: All HTML documents must have a basic structure that consists of three main sections: the header section, the body section, and the footer section.</li></p>
</ul>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Page Content -->
</body>
</html>
```


<p>This is the basic code of an HTML document, which can be further complemented with various tags and styles to generate a web page with different content.

It is important to mention that this is just a basic introduction to HTML, and there are many more details and functionalities that can be learned to create more complex websites.</p>
