<h1>HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h1>
<hr>
<p>It's a way for computers to communicate with each other and transfer information over the internet. Think of it like a set of rules and procedures that determine how data is sent and received between different devices.</p>

<h3>Here are some important points about HTTP:</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
    <li><b>HTTP</b> is the foundation of the internet: Almost all websites and web applications use HTTP to transfer data between the server and the client.</li>
    <li><b>HTTP</b> uses URLs: URLs, or uniform resource locators, are the addresses of websites and web pages on the internet. They begin with "http" or "https" and contain information about the location of the resource.</li>
    <li><b>HTTP</b> is stateless: This means that the server doesn't remember any information about previous requests or responses. Each request is treated as an independent transaction.</li>
    <li><b>HTTP</b> uses status codes: These codes are sent back in the server's response to indicate the outcome of the request. Common codes include 200 OK, 404 Not Found, and 500 Internal Server Error.</li>
    <li><b>HTTP</b> can be secure: The "s" in "https" stands for "secure." This means that the data being transferred is encrypted, making it more difficult for unauthorized parties to intercept or read it.</li>
</ul>
